# Email Management Agent - System Patterns

## System Architecture
The email management system will be built using a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Email Access Layer** - Secure interfaces to connect with Microsoft Outlook APIs
2. **Classification Engine** - AI-based categorization of emails by importance and type
3. **Action Engine** - Automated responses, filing, and unsubscribe functionalities
4. **Notification System** - Integration with calendars and reminder systems
5. **User Dashboard** - Interface for configuring rules and viewing stats

## Key Technical Decisions
- Use of OAuth 2.0 for secure email access
- API-first approach for compatibility with multiple frontends
- Implementation of machine learning for adaptive email categorization
- Local processing where possible for privacy and speed
- Cloud processing for more intensive tasks

## Architecture Patterns
- Event-driven architecture for real-time email processing
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service-oriented architecture for modularity
- Observer pattern for notification systems
- Strategy pattern for different email classification approaches
