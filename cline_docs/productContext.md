# Email Management Agent - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to help manage the user's overwhelming Microsoft Outlook inbox that contains thousands of unread emails (4,000-5,000). The user is very active online, signing up for various services and receiving numerous promotional emails, offers, and important communications that are getting lost in the noise.

## Problems It Solves
1. Email overwhelm - too many unread and unorganized emails
2. Missing important offers and communications
3. Difficulty distinguishing between important and unimportant emails
4. Lack of automated management for incoming emails
5. Need for reminders and calendar integration for important events

## How It Should Work
The solution will be implemented in two phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Cleanup
- Sort and organize 4,000-5,000 existing emails
- Identify important communications vs. promotional content
- Create a clean, organized inbox structure

### Phase 2: Ongoing Management
- Set up an AI agent to continuously manage new incoming emails
- Automatically categorize emails by importance
- Unsubscribe from unnecessary mailing lists
- Set up reminders and calendar notifications for important events
- Provide alerts (2 hours in advance) for critical time-sensitive matters

The agent should be intelligent, continuously improving, and aligned with the user's goals and values.
